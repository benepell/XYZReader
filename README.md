# XYZ-Reader app
It was evaluated by certified [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) code reviewer and was graded as "Exceeds Specifications".

## Why this Project?
As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App.

## What Will I Learn?
In this project you will:
* Use MediaPlayer/Exoplayer to display videos.
* Handle error cases in Android.
* Add a widget to your app experience.
* Leverage a third-party library in your app.
* Use Fragments to create a responsive design that works on phones and tablets.
